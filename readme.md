# Sunshine duration at Schiphol
This is a zoom & brush data visualization that I made for assessment 2 for the subject Front end 3. The code of this visualization was based on [Brush & Zoom](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172) by Mike Bostock (GNU v.3)

In this visualization you can see how much time in a day we had sun in Schiphol, The Netherlands.

## Data
The data that I used for my graph is from the [KNMI](http://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens/selectie.cgi). Here I selected the period from 2010/01/01 untill 2016/12/31, All the KNMI elements where selected and the station 240 Schiphol. 

The original data was "dirty data" in a `.txt` file. The file has: 
* An introduction text.
* An abbreviation explanation of the data.
* The data itself
    - Separated by commas and spaces. 

For my chart I used the following data:
* YYYYMMDD: Datum (YYYY=year MM=month DD=day); 
* SQ:  Sunshine duration (in 0.1 hour)

## Workflow
1. First I searched for a interesting data that I could work with it.
    - In the beginning I tried to work with multiple data sets from the cbs website. Un fornatually it didn't work that good for me. I spent too much time trying to clean it. I almost had cleaned the whole data but I got stuck when I had to remove one line text that was in the middle of my data. 
    - Because I had already spent a lot of time cleaning the data I chose to work with another data. So I decided to take a look in the data from the KNMI. I saw a lot of different possibilities of graphs that could work with this data and decided to work with it. 
2. After I downloaded the data and cleaned it. I took a lot in which data I found interesting to use. The data of the `sp`(Sunshine duration) column and the `DR` (Rainfall duration). And of course the date data. 
3. After I chose with which data I would work I tried to picture in my head what kind of graph I could display this data. 
    - The first thing that came to me was a bar chart and a scatter chart. 
    - I started coding my code like I was coding a bar chart but then I realized that I already had made I couple of bar charts in the last 3 weeks. So started thinking again for another kind of chart. 
    - I hadn't a lot of time left and that was bothering me, because it felt like it was restricting myself to challenge myself. 
    - After a lot of thinking and searching for ideas on the internet I had a inspiration to do a zoom and brush graph. My inspiration came from the [Brush & Zoom](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172) by Mike Bostock.
4. My following step was to link my cleaned data and the code from [Brush & Zoom](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172).
    - I did that in the first place to see if my cleaned data was working. 
    - When everything was working I played a little with his code to see if I understood everything it did.
5. Adding more features was my 5th step. I made a list of changes/features that I would like to make for the graph, like:
    - A nice visual with meaningful colors.
    - To add text to the x and y axis.
    - To add a tooltip that helps the visualization of the graph. 
    - To fix that the graph doesn't go outside the yaxis when scrolling. 
    - A button/ checkbox where I can change from `sunshine duration` to `rainfall duration`. 
    - A button/ checkbox where I can show both graphs in one. 
6. Writing a readme.md explaining my graph, data and workflow.  

### Changes made
#### HTML
* Gave it a basic HTML structure.
* Closed the `<body>` tag.
* Added a `h1`.

#### CSS
* Added a background color.
* Added a meaningful color to the chart.
    - I added a yellow and orange color to it that stands for the warmth. 
    ```
    .area {
        fill: #FDB813;
        stroke: #FF5721;
        stroke-width: .02em;
        clip-path: url(#clip);
    }
    ```

#### JS
* Cleaned the data file. 
    ```
    var header = doc.indexOf('STN,YYYYMMDD');
    var endHeader = doc.indexOf('\n', header);
    var parseTime = d3.timeParse('%Y%m%d')

    doc = doc.slice(endHeader);
    doc = doc.replace('#', '').trim();
    doc = doc.replace(/ +/g, '');
    ```
* Changed the `.scaleExtent([1, infinite])` to `.scaleExtent([1, 20])`
    - This means that the user can't zoom infinitely threw the chart. After 50 times zooming it stops. By this chart the maximum you can zoom is per day. 
    ```
    var zoom = d3.zoom()
    .scaleExtent([1, 50])
    .on('zoom', zoomed);
    ```
* Added text to the x and y axis.
    ```
    .append("text") // Add text 
    .attr("class", "label") // Add class element with the name of "label".
    .attr("transform", "rotate(-90)") // rotates element -90grades
    .attr("y", -40) // Set y position
    .style("text-anchor", "end") // Text end alignment
    .text("Duration (in 0.1 hour) ");
    ```

## Todo
- [ ] To add a tooltip that helps the visualization of the graph. 
- [ ] A button/ checkbox where I can change from `sunshine duration` to `rainfall duration`.
